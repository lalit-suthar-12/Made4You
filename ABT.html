        <p>Through the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen examples of exemplary courage among our frontline workers. Now, it’s time to bring their stories of bravery and determination to a bigger audience, so they may become symbols of our collective spirit during a tough time for the country. </p>

        <p>During the pandemic, we all are able to live safely from Covid-19 only due to Covid warriors. These warriors are risking their own life to protect the public and to keep us safe. But some irresponsible people are not following all Covid protocols and risking their own lives. I advise everyone to stay at home and follow the rules released by our government to keep us safe.</p>

        <p>We should only go out if it is an emergency and wear a double-layered mask. We must follow social distancing and sanitise our hands regularly. Doctors, nurses, other medical staff as well as policemen are working day and night to keep us safe. Even if we thank them as much as we can, is will still be less for the work they are doing for us.</p>

        <p>We should obey the rules the policemen ask us to follow. Because of their duty towards public service, they aren’t able to give time to their family. They have to stay away from their family the whole day just to protect the public from the virus.</p>

        <p>We can stay away from corona patients, but doctors have to be around the patients to cure them by wearing PPE kits, which make them feel hot and sweaty, while we sit under the fan all day. So, I would again like to thank all our Corona warriors. We should respect them as they are working day and night only for us, keeping our safety above their own family’s.</p>
